## Background

Motrix Next is built upon the ideas of [Motrix](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix) by [agalwood](https://github.com/agalwood). We are grateful to the original creators and contributors — their aria2 integration, i18n translations, and download logic served as invaluable reference throughout development.

The legacy Electron + Vue 2 stack had become difficult to maintain. Rather than patching further, Motrix Next rebuilds the application with a modern architecture:

- **Runtime** — Electron → **Tauri 2** (Rust-based, significantly smaller and lighter)
- **Frontend** — Vue 2 + Vuex + Element UI → **Vue 3 Composition API + Pinia + Naive UI**
- **Language** — JavaScript → **TypeScript**
- **Styling** — SCSS + Element theme → **Vanilla CSS + CSS custom properties**
- **Engine management** — Node.js `child_process` → **Tauri sidecar**
- **Build** — electron-builder → **Vite + Cargo**

Version numbering has been reset to reflect this clean break. The i18n translations (25+ languages), aria2 RPC protocol support, and overall UX philosophy have been preserved.

## Features

- **Multi-protocol downloads** — HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent, Magnet links
- **BitTorrent** — Selective file download, DHT, peer exchange, encryption
- **Tracker management** — Auto-sync from community tracker lists
- **Concurrent downloads** — Up to 10 tasks with configurable thread count
- **Speed control** — Global and per-task upload/download limits
- **System tray** — Real-time speed display in the menu bar (macOS)
- **Dark mode** — Native dark theme as default
- **Task management** — Pause, resume, delete with file cleanup, batch operations
- **Download protocols** — Register as default handler for magnet and thunder links
- **Notifications** — System notifications on task completion
- **Lightweight** — Tauri-based, minimal resource footprint
